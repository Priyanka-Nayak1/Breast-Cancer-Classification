# Breast-Cancer-Classification

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide. Early detection and accurate classification are crucial for successful treatment and prognosis. Breast cancer classification involves identifying whether a breast tumor is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Several techniques and models have been developed to assist in this classification process, utilizing various forms of data such as mammograms, biopsies, and patient records.

The classification process typically involves:

Data Collection: Features such as the size of the tumor, texture, and density are collected from imaging or biopsy reports.
Preprocessing: Data is cleaned and prepared, removing noise and normalizing feature values for better model accuracy.
Feature Extraction: Relevant features that may contribute to the classification (e.g., cell size, uniformity, and shape) are identified and extracted.
Modeling: Machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks are commonly used to build classifiers.
Evaluation: Models are evaluated based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure reliable classification.
In this project, we focus on building a machine learning model using publicly available breast cancer datasets (e.g., the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset) to classify breast tumors and provide insights into early diagnosis and treatment planning.
